				<h2>FAQ</h2>
			</div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="one-faq col-sm-4">
					<h3>When and where is CUTC Imagine?</h3>
					<p>CUTC will be held on May 7-8th at the MaRS Innovation District in the heart of downtown Toronto.
					</p>

					<h3>What’s different at CUTC then say, at a hackathon?</h3>
					<p>At CUTC, it’s not just about hacking. Sure, you can get your hands dirty and create things during our events like the Microsoft Machine Learning Challenge or CGI’s Imagine Challenge; however, you also get to learn from the people in the trenches--entrepreneurs, pioneers in technology and the guys who build and maintain the tech we use everyday.
					</p>

					<h3>Will there be conference subsidies?</h3>
					<p>Yes! We'll be realeasing more information very soon. Watch out on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ilovecutc/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/CUTC_Team" target="_blank">Twitter</a> for more updates!</p>
					
					<h3>Is a schedule available?</h3>
					<p>The schedule will be up very soon. We’re currently crafting something that gives you the best experience possible. </p>

<!-- 					Sit back, and subscribe for more updates!
					</p> -->
				</div>

				<div class="one-faq col-sm-4">
					<h3>What am I getting for my $$?</h3>
					<p>We’ve been working hard to cut prices as much as possible to make sure cost doesn’t get in your way. Early Bird Tickets are $30 and Regular Tickets are $50. We also have a buddy deal where you can get $10 off when you buy 2 tickets together.  You get access to keynotes, workshops, challenges, the Tech Expo, our pub night social, Bobby Motta’s world famous mentalist show (which normally costs $50 alone!) & delicious breakfast, lunch and dinner!
					</p>

					<h3>Where can I stay during the conference?</h3>
					<p>Need a place to stay for the weekend? We’ve got you covered! We've arranged a special deal with Mariott in downtown Toronto for just $45/night! All rooms will have 4 people. Just add an accommodation option on checkout. If a 4-star hotel stay with the CUTC fam ain't your thing, you can also try AirBnB, CouchSurfers or crashing at a friends place!
					</p>

					<h3>I still have questions!</h3>
					<p>Send 'em our way by shooting us a message on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ilovecutc/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> page!
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="one-faq col-sm-4">
<!-- 					<h3>I can’t attend anymore, can I get a refund?</h3>
					<p>CUTC will not be able to offer refunds to delegates unless they are under extenuating circumstances. If that is the case, please e-mail <a href="mailto:info@cutc.ca" target="_blank">info@cutc.ca</a>. Otherwise, we do extend the option of transferring your ticket to another person.</p> -->

					<h3>I'm coming from outside Toronto - how do I get there?</h3>
					<p>We'll be arranging FREE buses to/from schools with the most students registered. Currently, we anticipate providing free transportation to/from UWaterloo. We also have a deal with VIA Rail for 10% OFF if you book with discount code "13274".</p>

					<h3>Can I transfer my ticket to another person?</h3>
					<p>Absolutely, just send us a message on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ilovecutc/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> page with the details and we’ll send that person a link to fill out a new registration form so they don’t have to use your name tag.
					</p>

					<h3>I’m interested in volunteering for CUTC, how can I get involved?</h3>
					<p>Applications for volunteers will be released in late March. Watch out on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ilovecutc/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/CUTC_Team" target="_blank">Twitter</a> for more updates!
